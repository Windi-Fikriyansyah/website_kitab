Dar Ibnu Abbas was founded in 2020 with one overarching goal: to become a platform for students of knowledge in Indonesia. We believe that the revival of the ummah can only be built on a solid foundation of knowledge. From a simple dream, "What if the books of scholars could be distributed, read, and practiced?" a literacy journey was born that has now grown into a real movement. Initially, we began with book reviews, introducing readers to the treasures of turats (traditional Islamic heritage) so they wouldn't be lost in the pages of history. Slowly, this step grew until our collection reached over 8,000 titles, which continues to grow over time. All of our books are sourced directly from official Middle Eastern publishers and contemporary scholars, ensuring their authenticity and quality. Alhamdulillah, along the way, Dar Ibnu Abbas has gained the trust not only of readers in Indonesia but also of students abroad. Our customers come from the Netherlands, Malaysia, Mauritania, and even Saudi Arabia, while international shipping has reached the United Kingdom, the United States, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates. What sets us apart is: an offline store that can be visited directly in Jakarta. Book reviews that help readers understand the contents. Scientific studies and hiwariyyah jalsah with ustadz and book authors. A commitment to service to present books with trustworthiness and professionalism, both for local and international readers. More than just a bookstore, Dar Ibnu Abbas is part of the struggle for Islamic literacy. We are here to serve the community, so that they become more knowledgeable, faithful, and do good deeds with the books of scholars as a lantern that lights the way.
